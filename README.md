Personal Website 101!

I am creating this website for the puropse of learning to develop a professional webpage to showcase my abilities in website development.
I will be adding basic styling using css with colors and graphics. This will be my first attempt at doing something of this nature. This is also a new learning experience at using GitHub for this purpose.
