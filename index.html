       <p>My professional intrests are some what diffcult to explain because i currently have my dream job. I do however wish to learn how to program, script, and project manage. I feel that by adding these three skill sets to my portfoilo, i have a better chance at job security and the possibility of moving up to a different role within the University.</p>
	   
	   <p>I strongly feel that lacking the programming side i could end up without a job in the coming years with the advancement of AI. Programmers will still be needed and sought after to write the code for AI projects. Scripting has many different usages from building a program that allows someone to pick from a list, to creating content on a global scale. And project management is needed for all areas to have the ability to get on track and stay on track.</p>
